# Typescript.ts

`TypeScript`

Typescript.ts is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that enables developers to generate or bootstrap their TypeScript project structures from scratch using a small grammar. This was created as a group project for Advanced Software Engineering at UBC.

## Implementation

The DSL file is tokenized and then parsed through an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Different files and directories are generated based on which nodes of the AST are reached.
