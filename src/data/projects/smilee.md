Smilee is a endless sidescroller that has a bunny hopping over carrots to avoid dying. Along the way, when you reach certain scores, the game will prompt a camera to appear and take a picture of your face. Based on the facial expression, the game will use [Microsoft's Cognitive Services API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/#overview) to retrieve the most prominent emotion. Depending on which emotion is detected, your in-game character will get a special ability.
