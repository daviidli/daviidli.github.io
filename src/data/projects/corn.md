`React` `TypeScript`

## Inspiration

I started making these components because I was getting tired of the look of the mainstream React component libraries out there, such as [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/). Although I really like their API, I felt myself customizing their components every time I used them. Having created a few components for the UI kit at IBM, I thought I would give it another try and create my own from scratch. I quickly found out that the mindset and considerations needed are quite different from developing for my other React projects. I'm still experimenting with considerations such as the design and the ability to customize without CSS. You can view my progress at [bit.dev/daviidli/corn-ui](https://bit.dev/daviidli/corn-ui).
