I'm a recent graduate from the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) in Vancouver 🍁. My studies were focused on Business and Computer Science. I believe that being multidisciplinary and always learning is  important because rarely do tasks require only one skill. I am currently getting a crash course in electronics and customer interaction while on the job, but am also seeking a software development position to build upon the computer science experience I have gained from school.
