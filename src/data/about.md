I'm a recent graduate from the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) in Vancouver üçÅ. My studies were focused on Business and Computer Science. I believe that being multidisciplinary and always learning is extremely important because rarely do tasks require only one skill set. Learning about how everyday things are designed and operated are one of my favourites (check out the [99% Invisible](https://99pi.org) podcast). I am currently getting a crash course in electronics while on the job, but I am also seeking a software development position to build upon the computer science experience I have gained from school.
