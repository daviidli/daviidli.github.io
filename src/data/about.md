As a recent graduate with a Combined Major in Business and Computer Science, I have a strong interest in both disciplines. From my courses and co-op experiences, I found that I was most satisfied when trying to solve a problem. Whether it be from the business perspective, where I am looking to find the bottleneck in a business process, or from the technical perspective, where I am looking to optimize an algorithm, I enjoy collaborating with teammates and finding unique solutions that fit within the constraints. Apart from that, my experience with the people in the software development industry has taught me that this industry is vast and everyone brings different expertise to the table. Working with new people is always thrilling because it gives me a chance to learn from their technical skills, as well as the perspective they bring to problem-solving.
