I'm a recent graduate from the [University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca) in Vancouver üçÅ. My studies were focused on Business and Computer Science, and I have a strong interest in both. I enjoy working in software development as it always presents interesting and complex problems that need to be solved. I am not a very skilled problem solver by any means, but I learned from my previous internships that with collaboration, problems can be solved faster and more effectively.


Have a project you want to collaborate on? Feel free to reach out! I'm always looking to learn.
